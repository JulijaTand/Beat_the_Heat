# Beat_the_Heat
Our project seeks to explore the feasibility of Germany achieving a renewable energy consumption target by 2030. By applying predictive models and historical data, we aim to provide insights into the country’s progress toward this ambitious sustainability goal
## Hypotheses

▪️ H1: 50% of German states consume renewable energy above the country's share.

▪️ H2: The top (renewable consumption) states adopt the same energy scheme.

▪️ H3: Energy consumption reduced by 30% as of 2030 (compared to 2008).

▪️ H4: 42.5% of energy consumption coming from renewables by 2030

## Datasets

- Per state: [2017-2020](https://www.lak-energiebilanzen.de/eingabe-statisch/?a=e600 )

## Our Approach
We have gathered extensive datasets on energy consumption and renewable energy sources in Germany to accomplish our mission and investigate the hypotheses. We employed data analysis and machine learning techniques to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
